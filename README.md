# GapYearVoyage
GapYearVoyage is a page dedicated to helping students who are in their gap year after high school. It was inspired after seeing a lot of kids leave high school and not sure what they can do in their gap year or simply just do not do anything in that time. 

The page will provide insight and information  on the activities you can do while on a gap year, There will be tips offered and advice on how to make the most of their gap year, including budgeting, planning, and setting goals.
